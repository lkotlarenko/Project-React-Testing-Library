## Heads up

In this project, I developed tests with React-Testing-Library for an application provided by [Trybe](https://betrybe.com).

## Skills

* Use React-Testing-Library selectors (queries) on automated tests.

* Simulate events with react-testing-library in automated tests.

* Test asynchronous logic flows with react-testing-library.

* Write tests that allow the structure of the application components to be refined without changing.

* Create API mocks using fetch.

* Test inputs.
